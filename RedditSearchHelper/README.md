### Credit for Project Start

The overwhelming majority of this was built by [@filahf](https://www.filipahfelt.se/), and can be seen on his youtube sync website https://wevid.online/. I (@stuckinaboot) just simplified the code to make using this within an iframe trivial. Some core youtube sync ideas were used from [@YasserYka](https://github.com/YasserYka/YT-API).
